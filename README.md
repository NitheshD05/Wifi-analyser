**DoS and DDoS Attacks:** Conducts Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attacks on specified targets.

**Fake Authentication:** Performs fake authentication against a specified WiFi network.

**Capture Handshakes:** Captures handshake packets for WPA/WPA2 networks.

**Wordlist Creation:** Generates wordlists using crunch for use in password cracking.

**Password Cracking**: Cracks WPA/WPA2 passwords using captured handshakes and wordlists.

**WPS Scanning and Attacks:** Scans for WPS-enabled networks and performs WPS PIN attacks using reaver.

**IP Forwarding:** Enables IP forwarding on the system.

**Packet Sniffing:** Sniffs network packets on a specified interface.

**ARP Spoofing:** Performs ARP spoofing attacks on a network.

**Port Scanning:** Scans specified IP address ranges for open ports.

**ARP Spoof Detection:** Detects ARP spoofing attacks on the network.

## Prerequisites

## Details
**1. Monitor Mode Activation**

Activates monitor mode on a specified network interface. This mode allows the interface to capture all packets in the vicinity, including those not addressed to the device. Essential for network analysis and packet sniffing.

**2. WiFi Scanning**

Scans for available WiFi networks and displays detailed information. Includes BSSID, signal strength, channel, and encryption type. Helps identify nearby networks and their characteristics.

**3. Target Monitoring**

Monitors a specific target (BSSID) on a specified channel. Provides real-time updates on the target's activity, such as packet count and signal strength. Useful for tracking a particular device.

**4. DoS Attack**

Conducts a Denial of Service attack on a specified target. Disrupts the target's network connectivity by overwhelming it with requests. Effective for testing network robustness.

**5. DDoS Attack**

Performs a Distributed Denial of Service attack using multiple devices. Floods the target with excessive traffic, causing network disruptions. Useful for stress-testing network defenses.

**6. Fake Authentication**

Attempts fake authentication against a specified WiFi network. Tries to associate with the access point without needing a valid password. Helps in testing network security.

**7. Manage Mode**

Switches the network interface back to managed mode from monitor mode. Restores normal network operation, allowing the device to connect to WiFi networks. Ensures seamless network transitions.

**8. Capturing Handshakes**

Captures WPA/WPA2 handshake packets for offline password cracking. Essential for testing network security by attempting to recover passwords from captured handshakes.

**9. Creating Wordlist**

Generates custom wordlists using crunch based on specified parameters. Creates tailored lists of potential passwords for use in brute force attacks. Supports various customization options.

**10. Cracking Password**

Cracks WPA/WPA2 passwords using captured handshakes and wordlists. Employs brute force or dictionary attacks to recover network passwords. Validates network security measures.

**11. WPS Scanning**

Scans for WPS-enabled networks, providing details on their WPS capabilities. Identifies networks that may be vulnerable to WPS-based attacks. Helps in assessing network security.

**12. IP Forwarding**

Enables IP forwarding on the system, allowing packet forwarding between interfaces. Facilitates network routing and bridging. Essential for certain network configurations and attacks.

**13. WPS PIN Attack**

Uses reaver to perform a WPS PIN attack, brute forcing the WPS PIN. Attempts to gain access to the network by exploiting WPS vulnerabilities. Tests the security of WPS-enabled networks.

**14. Packet Sniffing**

Sniffs network packets on a specified interface, capturing data for analysis. Useful for monitoring network traffic and identifying potential issues or attacks.

**15. ARP Spoofing**

Performs ARP spoofing attacks, redirecting network traffic through the attackerâ€™s machine. Useful for man-in-the-middle attacks and network traffic interception.

**16. Port Scanning**

Scans specified IP ranges for open ports, revealing available services. Identifies potential security vulnerabilities by detecting open ports and running services.

**17. ARP Spoof Detection**

Detects ARP spoofing attacks on the network, alerting users to potential threats. Helps in maintaining network security by identifying malicious activities.
